10. Royalty
You agree to pay abdelilah majid a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable to
each Product, regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or legal
entity, as follows:
a. Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end users through any and all
media, including but not limited to digital and retail;
b. Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content,
microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of content created by end users for use
with a Product, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a Product or made externally but
which directly affect the operation of the Product;
c. Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly
associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount
is established in an early tier solely for Product access, your royalty obligation will apply to that
amount for each backer with the same access, but not on additional amounts in higher tiers based
on ancillary benefits);
d. Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;
e. Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise);
f. Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product including in form of streaming,
subscription, or other Product delivery service (unless excluded below).
However, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:
1. The first $200,000 in gross revenue for each Product per calendar year;
2. Consulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services performed using
the Licensed Technology (e.g., an architect-created walkthrough simulation or a
contractor-developed in-house training simulator);
3. Revenue from a Product that solely relies on the Licensed Technology for production of
non-interactive linear media (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, or movies) and which
is Distributed in a form that does not contain the Licensed Technology or, in order to deliver, rely on
servers running the Licensed Technology;
4. Revenue from a Product that is only Distributed to Engine Licensees (such as through the
Store);
5. Revenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do not contain embedded
information (such as QR codes) that affects the operation of the Product (e.g., comic books,
soundtracks, apparel);
6. Financial winnings generated by awards for the Product;
7. Revenue from donations for a Product that are not tied to Product access or in-Product
benefits; and
8. Revenue from interactive amusement park rides which use the Licensed Technology.
The royalty is based on gross revenue from end users, regardless of whether you sell your Product
to end users directly, self-publish via the Windows Store or any similar store, or work with a
publisher. The following simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty to gross sales: if
your Product earns $100 on the store, store owner may pay you $70 (as example having deducted
30% as a distribution fee), but your royalty to abdelilah majid would still be 5% of $100 (or $5).
Royalties that you pay on advance payment of revenue for a Product that is recoupable by the
payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under
this Agreement for that Product.
Royalties must be reported and paid on a per-Product basis. The $250,000 per Product per
calendar year royalty exemption may not be aggregated across multiple Products.
Within 45 days after the end of each calendar year in which a Product earns revenue outside of
the above-listed royalty exclusions, you must pay to abdelilah majid the full amount of the royalty due for that
year and send abdelilah majid a royalty report on a per Product basis. Detailed information on royalty
reporting and payment can be found at https://github.com/MajidAbdelilah/Majid/blob/master/Commercial%20Product%20Release%20Guidelines
The royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each Product for as long as any
Engine Code or Content (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in or used to
make the Product are protected under the copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.
5. Payments
abdelilah majid reserves the right to charge a 10% late fee, per calendar year (compounding), for any
amounts unpaid after the required due date.
You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under this Agreement
(other than taxes that abdelilah majid is obligated to pay on its income, which are abdelilah majid’s responsibility). If you
are required by a government agency to reduce your payment to abdelilah majid for any reason, you are
required to provide sufficient documentation to abdelilah majid supporting the withholding. For questions about
withholding taxes or taxes in general, please contact at https://github.com/MajidAbdelilah/Majid/issues
