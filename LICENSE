Majid End-User License Agreement
Last updated: April 14, 2023
Please read this End-User License Agreement ("Agreement") carefully before clicking the "I Agree"
button, downloading, or using Majid Engine ("Application") or related content.
By clicking the "I Agree" button, downloading or using the Application, you are agreeing to be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not click on the "I Agree" button and do not
download or use the Application.
If you are separately licensed under a Custom License, certain terms of this Agreement do not apply
to your Custom Products. Those terms are described below in Section 19.
Additionally, certain words or phrases are defined to have certain meanings when used in this
Agreement. Those words and phrases are defined below in Section 18.
1. License
Majid grants you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to download, install
and use the Application solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes strictly in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement (the "License").
The License becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement or download the Engine
Code or any Content. The License does not grant you any title or ownership in the Licensed
Technology.
(A) Allowed forms of Distribution and Sublicensing
You may only Distribute the Licensed Technology as follows:
a. Distribution to end users - You may Distribute the Licensed Technology incorporated in object
code format only as an inseparable part of a Product to end users who are subject to an end user
license agreement that explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities
related to the Licensed Technology. The Product may not contain any Paid Content Distributed in
uncooked source format or any Engine Tools.
b. Distribution to other licensees - You may Distribute Engine Code (including as modified by you
under the License) in Source Code or object code format, or any Content, to an Engine Licensee
who has rights under its license to the same Version of the Engine Code or Content that you are
Distributing.
Any public Distribution (i.e., intended for Engine Licensees generally) which includes Engine Tools
(including as modified by you under the License) must take place either through the Store (e.g., for
distributing a Product’s modding tool or editor to end users) or through a fork of Majid’s GitHub
Network (e.g., for distributing source code).
c. Distributions to employees and contractors - You also may Distribute Content (other than Paid
Plug-ins) to an Engine Licensee who is your employee or your contractor who does not have rights
under their license to the same Content, but only to permit that Engine Licensee to utilize that
Content in good faith to develop a Product on your behalf for Distribution by you under the License,
and not for the purpose of Content pooling or any other Distribution or sublicensing of Content that
is not permitted under this Agreement. Recipients of such a Distribution have a limited license to
use, reproduce, display, perform, and modify that Content to develop your Product as outlined
above, and for no other purpose.
d. Distribution of Paid Plug-ins - You may Distribute Paid Plug-ins to each of your Paid Plug-in
Users so that they may use those Paid Plug-ins on your behalf under the License.
e. Distribution and sublicensing of Samples - You may Distribute or sublicense Samples (including
as modified by you under the License) in Source Code or object code format to any third party.
However, the rights in this Section 1(e) do not expand or modify your limited Distribution and
sublicensing rights for Engine Code and Content (including as modified by you under the License)
that are not Samples.
You are permitted to post snippets of Engine Code, up to 30 lines of code in length, online in public
forums for the sole purpose of discussing the content of the snippet, or distribute such snippets in
connection with supporting patches and plug-ins for the Licensed Technology, so long as it is not for
the purpose of enabling non-Engine Licensees to use or modify any Engine Code, or to aggregate,
recombine, or reconstruct any larger portion of the Engine Code.
You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology in Source Code format. You may not sublicense
the Licensed Technology in object code format, or any Content, except to grant end users the ability
to use, or to permit your publishers and distributors to market and Distribute, a Product that you
Distribute as permitted in Section 1(a) above. This paragraph does not limit your rights to Distribute
and sublicense Samples.
When you generate revenue from a Product or Distribute it to end users, you must provide Majid with
advance notification at https://github.com/MajidAbdelilah/Majid/pulls, as early as reasonably possible, including
name of the Product, the format of distribution, unique Product id (where applicable), and the
distribution channel(s).
(B) Majid-Only Content
For Majid-Only Content, you may exercise your rights under the License only if and to the extent that
the Majid-Only Content is utilized in combination with the Engine Code. For example, you may not
develop or Distribute a Product that consists of or contains Majid-Only Content but does not contain
and require the Engine Code (including as modified by you under the License) for its use. The
Majid-Only Content is subject to all of the terms of this Agreement that apply to Content, as well as
the additional limitations described in this paragraph. All references in this paragraph to Majid-Only
Content include modified versions thereof made by you under the License.
(C) Non-Compatible Licenses
You may not combine, Distribute, or otherwise use the Licensed Technology with any code or other
content which is covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the
Licensed Technology be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement
(“Non-Compatible License”). Code or content under the following licenses, for example, are
prohibited: GNU General Public License (GPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely
dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. Code or
content under the following licenses, for example, are allowed: BSD License, MIT License,
Microsoft Public License, or Apache License. You may not sublicense the Licensed Technology
under a Non-Compatible License.
(D) General Restrictions
You may not engage in any activity with respect to the Licensed Technology, including as
incorporated into a Product, (1) in violation of any applicable law or regulation; (2) in which the
Licensed Technology is rented or leased; (3) that misappropriates any of Majid’s other products or
services; (4) in support of a claim by you or any third party that the Licensed Technology infringes a
patent. You also may not sell or grant a security interest in the Licensed Technology.
2. Restrictions
You agree not to, and you will not permit others to:license, sell, rent, lease, assign, distribute,
transmit, host, outsource, disclose or otherwise commercially exploit the Application or make the
Application available to any third party.
The Licensed Technology is licensed to you for use by a single User (other than Paid Plug-ins,
which may also be used by your Paid Plug-in Users as described below). The User may store the
Licensed Technology on any of the User’s computers, but the Licensed Technology cannot be
shared with others (including any other employees or agents) except through a permitted
Distribution as described above.
Under the License, the User may use the Licensed Technology for as long as you comply with this
Agreement. If you are a legal entity, references to “you” in this agreement also apply to the User in
all cases. You are responsible for the User’s compliance with this Agreement.
For Paid Plug-ins, in addition, to use by a single User, each Paid Plug-in User with respect to whom
you have paid the associated fee may store the Paid Plug-in on any of the Paid Plug-in User’s
computers and may use the Paid Plug-in on your behalf under the License, but the Paid Plug-in
cannot be otherwise shared with others except through a permitted Distribution as described above.
You are responsible for each Paid Plug-in User’s compliance with this Agreement.
If you are an Academic Institution, your use is not limited to a single User for any Licensed
Technology other than Paid Content. Instead, you may store that Licensed Technology on any of
your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use that Licensed Technology
under the License. However, those users are not authorized under your License to Distribute or
sublicense the Licensed Technology (including as incorporated in a Product). For that, they must
obtain a License of their own.
3. Modifications to Application
Majid reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the
Application or any service to which it connects, with or without notice and without liability to you.
4. Royalty
You agree to pay Majid a royalty equal to 5% of all worldwide gross revenue actually attributable to
each Product, regardless of whether that revenue is received by you or any other person or legal
entity, as follows:
a. Gross revenue resulting from any and all sales of a Product to end users through any and all
media, including but not limited to digital and retail;
b. Gross revenue resulting from any and all in-app purchases, downloadable content,
microtransactions, subscriptions, sale, transfer, or exchange of content created by end users for use
with a Product, or redemption of virtual currency, either within a Product or made externally but
which directly affect the operation of the Product;
c. Gross revenue from any Kickstarter or other crowdfunding campaign which is directly
associated with Product access or in-Product benefit (e.g., in a multi-tiered campaign, if an amount
is established in an early tier solely for Product access, your royalty obligation will apply to that
amount for each backer with the same access, but not on additional amounts in higher tiers based
on ancillary benefits);
d. Your revenue from in-app advertising and affiliate programs;
e. Revenue from advance payments for a Product (from a publisher or otherwise);
f. Revenue in any other form actually attributable to a Product including in form of streaming,
subscription, or other Product delivery service (unless excluded below).
However, no royalty is owed on the following forms of revenue:
1. The first $200,000 in gross revenue for each Product per calendar year;
2. Consulting fees or work-for-hire fees which are non-recoupable for services performed using
the Licensed Technology (e.g., an architect-created walkthrough simulation or a
contractor-developed in-house training simulator);
3. Revenue from a Product that solely relies on the Licensed Technology for production of
non-interactive linear media (e.g., broadcast or streamed video files, cartoons, or movies) and which
is Distributed in a form that does not contain the Licensed Technology or, in order to deliver, rely on
servers running the Licensed Technology;
4. Revenue from a Product that is only Distributed to Engine Licensees (such as through the
Store);
5. Revenue from ancillary products which are not software and which do not contain embedded
information (such as QR codes) that affects the operation of the Product (e.g., comic books,
soundtracks, apparel);
6. Financial winnings generated by awards for the Product;
7. Revenue from donations for a Product that are not tied to Product access or in-Product
benefits; and
8. Revenue from interactive amusement park rides which use the Licensed Technology.
The royalty is based on gross revenue from end users, regardless of whether you sell your Product
to end users directly, self-publish via the Windows Store or any similar store, or work with a
publisher. The following simplified example illustrates the application of the royalty to gross sales: if
your Product earns $100 on the store, store owner may pay you $70 (as example having deducted
30% as a distribution fee), but your royalty to Majid would still be 5% of $100 (or $5).
Royalties that you pay on advance payment of revenue for a Product that is recoupable by the
payer, such as a publisher, may be credited against future royalty payments that you incur under
this Agreement for that Product.
Royalties must be reported and paid on a per-Product basis. The $200,000 per Product per 
calendar year royalty exemption may not be aggregated across multiple Products.
Within 45 days after the end of each calendar quarter in which a Product earns revenue outside of
the above-listed royalty exclusions, you must pay to Majid the full amount of the royalty due for that
quarter and send Majid a royalty report on a per Product basis. Detailed information on royalty
reporting and payment can be found at https://github.com/MajidAbdelilah/Majid/blob/master/Commercial%20Pro
The royalty will be payable under this Agreement with respect to each Product for as long as any
Engine Code or Content (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in or used to
make the Product are protected under the copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.
5. Payments
Majid reserves the right to charge a 10% late fee, per calendar quarter (compounding), for any
amounts unpaid after the required due date.
You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made by you under this Agreement
(other than taxes that Majid is obligated to pay on its income, which are Majid’s responsibility). If you
are required by a government agency to reduce your payment to Majid for any reason, you are
required to provide sufficient documentation to Majid supporting the withholding. For questions about
withholding taxes or taxes in general, please go to https://github.com/MajidAbdelilah/Majid/issues.
6. Feedback and Contributions
If you provide Majid with any Feedback, Majid is free to use the Feedback however it chooses. If you
make any Contribution available to Majid, you hereby assign to Majid all right, title, and interest
(including all copyright, patent, and other intellectual property rights) in that Contribution for all
current and future methods and forms of exploitation in any country. If any of those rights are not
effectively assigned under applicable law, you hereby grant Majid a non-exclusive, fully-paid,
irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly
display, make, use, have made, sell, offer to sell, import, modify and make derivative works based
on, and otherwise exploit that Contribution for all current and future methods and forms of
exploitation in any country. If any of those rights may not be assigned or licensed under applicable
law (such as moral and other personal rights), you hereby waive and agree not to assert all of those
rights. However, you may continue to freely use any Feedback that you provide to Majid, and you
may continue to use, in any manner consistent with the License, any Contribution that you make
available to Majid.
You understand and agree that Majid is not required to make any use of any Feedback or
Contribution that you provide. You agree that if Majid makes use of your Feedback or Contribution,
Majid is not required to credit or compensate you for your contribution.
You represent and warrant that you have sufficient rights in any Feedback or Contribution that you
provide to Majid to grant Majid and other affected parties the rights described above. This includes
but is not limited to intellectual property rights and other proprietary or personal rights.
7. Proprietary Notices and Attribution
You agree to retain and reproduce in all copies of the Licensed Technology the copyright,
trademark, and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Majid and third parties as they appear in
the Engine Code and the Content.
You agree to place the following notices in the credits for any Product (replacing xxxx with the
current year):

No other license or right in the Majid Trademarks is granted under this Agreement. All use of the Majid
Trademarks will inure to the sole benefit of Majid. You agree not to engage in any activity that could
tarnish, dilute, or affect the validity or enforceability of the Majid Trademarks or cause consumer
confusion or diminish any goodwill relating to any Majid Trademarks. If you wish to make further use
of the Majid Trademarks, please contact me in this page https://github.com/MajidAbdelilah/Majid/issues.
Majid may use your trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos used with any Product, as
well as publicly released screenshots and video content from the Product, in connection with Majid’s
marketing, advertisement, and promotion of the Majid Engine in any and all media without restriction.
8. Hardware and Usage Data
You acknowledge that, as a default setting, the Engine Code will collect and send to Majid
anonymous hardware and basic usage data from end users of Engine Tools. This functionality is
used by Majid to improve the Engine Code. You may modify the Engine Tools settings under the
License to turn off that functionality.
9. Indemnity
Engine Code or Content (including as modified by you under the License) incorporated in or used to
make the Product are protected under the copyright or other applicable intellectual property law.
