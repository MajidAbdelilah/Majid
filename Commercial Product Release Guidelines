Commercial Product Release Guidelines

Before you ship your commercial game or any other product please perform a few simple steps.

We’re ready to help.
Product Checklist

Here is a sample checklist with helper tasks to do before your product release:

    Don’t use debug or any test builds, cook your game in Release mode for best performance.
    Prepare an EULA for your product which explicitly disclaims any representations, warranties, conditions, and liabilities related to the Flax Engine.
    Include the following credits to your product: “[Product Name] uses the Flax Engine. Copyright 2023 – [year], Abdelilah Majid. All rights reserved.”
    Validate any Flax-related logos and content with Branding Guidelines.
    Ensure that your product complies with all applicable laws, regulations, and rules.

Royality Payments

As soon as you’ve begun collecting money for your product (in e.g. sold units or in-app purchases as described in EULA), you’ll be obligated to track gross revenue and pay a 4% royalty on that amount after your product earn first $250,000 (per game per calendar quarter).
To report your product earning, complete and submit this form.

Here is an example:
Gross Revenue in Quarter = $300,000
Royalty Amount Due = ($300,000 – $200,000) * 5% = $5,000

If you have any questions feel free to ask.
